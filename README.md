Quality of no-life improvements for AniList

## Features
Currently there is only one feature: Media search bar

### Media search bar
This lets you search and add media links (anime/manga/light novel) to your forum threads, replies, reviews and statuses more easily. No more Ctrl+S to find the media. Just type the name and click on the media you want.

The bar is meant to be a tool for quick lookups, not for thorough searches, so there's only three filters: whether to include anime, manga and adult content. 

## Installation
1. Make sure you have a userscript manager. I recommend [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), but [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is also popular.
2. Install the userscript by going to this link: 
3. That's it. You can opt out/in of userscript updates if you wish.

## Build
You can inspect the source and build it yourself. Make sure you have Node and Webpack installed and run:
```
npm run build
```
on the project root directory.
